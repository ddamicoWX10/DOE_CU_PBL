# DOE_CU_PBL
Repository containing the scripts described in the DOE_ASR_PBL_project drive that DDamico has used to work with LASSO, CCPP SCM, and the provided LIDAR observations.

Directories in alphabetical order:
MLH-PBLH -- Files that work with CCPP SCM, LIDAR, and wrfstat to plot heights of the mixing layer and planetary boundary layer.
SCM-Contour -- Files that work with CCPP SCM output with selected variables to make time-height plots of PBL variables.
SCM-Prep -- Files that take LASSO inputs and prepare the data to be run in the CCPP SCM (non-DEPHY compliant).
SCM-Statistic -- Files that work with CCPP SCM outputs to plot box-whisker diagrams and standard deviations of selected variables.
WRFSTAT -- Files that subset the LASSO wrfstat data.

Damico_WorkDoc.pdf is also available in this repository, which describes the files in greater detail.
